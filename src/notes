-enzyme: React is automated
-nightwatch: Userinteraction is automated

issues when bringing login function over from auth0 default app:
-node_modules/auth0-lock/lib/i18n.js: util module is somehow cannot be imported completely.
It is imported but has empty contents, typically no "format" function that is used. So this part is hardcoded

issues with auth0:
-same origin policy: configure "allow callback url" on auth0 account
-from the reactapp perspective a new account must be created. the auth0 account cannot be used here dummy !

issues with setting up testing framework (enzyme):
-Mocha does not understand "import"
-Mocha does not understand JSX
-when using "export default" then only "import" works, not "require", WTF ?
-Mocha tests are not run in browser, so localStorage is not available and needs simulating => npm dom-storage


babel's presets to use:
es2015: for import statements
react: for jsx
