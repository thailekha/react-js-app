-next: use the "having" to display more detailss
-issue with re-rendering createbox when switching browsing mode
-add paradigms: add parent and childparadigm

React does not allow any object with keys i.e. ID to be sent down the hierarchy as props

issue: -after signing up
-after creating a library

found issue: localStage was programmed to be cleared when response comes back -> token is cleared too
issue found in Browswpage.js: typeof localStorage === undefined is not the proper way to check if the frontend has localStorage. This was previously included to run test with enzyme where the browser is not used so localStorage is not available

implement lodash in util
if library is not available => no tabs
when logging in, check if localstorage already have library object that does not matches user's email, delete if available. Or just call it library + email

To refactor:
-a button to report renders
-use proptypes to ensure auth object is trustable, refer to Home.old.js
-is time required to be sync w auth0 server ? (laptop is UTC + 7)
-clear "libraryundefined" in localStorage
-webpack back to react-scripts
-id fields of library is string after retrieving from localstograge ?
-e.preventDefault

Old logout solution:
-pass auth to nav bar and logout directly from there, cannot use logout stub because cannot pass auth to a route
-cannot put nav bar in Container and shouldn't put it in each view component => create another "app" component

Dot graph:
graph {
	Index -- MyApp -- Router -- Container -- Login;
	Container -- Homepage;
}

***JavaScripts Function.prototype.apply***

"start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development hjs-dev-server"
webpack config app.js -> index.js
review all the "join"s in webpack config

uninstall util
node's util module (check nodejs doc)
node-libs-browser -> sinon -> util
bug in an imported thing whose location cannot be accurately determined
-> completely remove it and see how it goes

-enzyme: React is automated
-nightwatch: Userinteraction is automated

issues when bringing login function over from auth0 default app:
-node_modules/auth0-lock/lib/i18n.js: util module is somehow cannot be imported completely.
It is imported but has empty contents, typically no "format" function that is used. So this part is hardcoded

issues with auth0:
-same origin policy: configure "allow callback url" on auth0 account
-from the reactapp perspective a new account must be created. the auth0 account cannot be used here dummy !

issues with setting up testing framework (enzyme):
-Mocha does not understand "import"
-Mocha does not understand JSX
-when using "export default" then only "import" works, not "require", WTF ?
-Mocha tests are not run in browser, so localStorage is not available and needs simulating => npm dom-storage


babel's presets to use:
es2015: for import statements
react: for jsx
