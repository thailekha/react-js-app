At homepage, if user does not have library yet, render createbox => use user's email to make new library
implement lodash in util
ID is handled by json-server, notthing to worry
if library is not available => no tabs
when logging in, check if localstorage already have library object that does not matches user's email, delete if available. Or just call it library + email

To refactor:
-a button to report renders
-use proptypes to ensure auth object is trustable, refer to Home.old.js

Old logout solution:
-pass auth to nav bar and logout directly from there, cannot use logout stub because cannot pass auth to a route
-cannot put nav bar in Container and shouldn't put it in each view component => create another "app" component

Dot graph:
graph {
	Index -- MyApp -- Router -- Container -- Login;
	Container -- Homepage;
}

webpack config app.js -> index.js
review all the "join"s in webpack config

uninstall util
node's util module (check nodejs doc)
node-libs-browser -> sinon -> util
bug in an imported thing whose location cannot be accurately determined
-> completely remove it and see how it goes

-enzyme: React is automated
-nightwatch: Userinteraction is automated

issues when bringing login function over from auth0 default app:
-node_modules/auth0-lock/lib/i18n.js: util module is somehow cannot be imported completely.
It is imported but has empty contents, typically no "format" function that is used. So this part is hardcoded

issues with auth0:
-same origin policy: configure "allow callback url" on auth0 account
-from the reactapp perspective a new account must be created. the auth0 account cannot be used here dummy !

issues with setting up testing framework (enzyme):
-Mocha does not understand "import"
-Mocha does not understand JSX
-when using "export default" then only "import" works, not "require", WTF ?
-Mocha tests are not run in browser, so localStorage is not available and needs simulating => npm dom-storage


babel's presets to use:
es2015: for import statements
react: for jsx
